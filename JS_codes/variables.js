// Today we are gonna learn about let, const and var

// Something you store, you need a memory space.

let name = "Nihal" // We use let to declear a num, string, char, etc.
var rollNo = 23 // var is same as let but don't use var as it gets buggy and the compilor sometimes make irresistable error understanding it

const iD = "abc123" // constant variables are those whose values can't be modified later on after declaration.

console.log(`My name is ${name}, roll no is ${rollNo}, and my personal id is ${iD}.`)
